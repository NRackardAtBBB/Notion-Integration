Since then, BBB has been an innovator in expanding the definition of preservation by creating new life in historic structures and public spaces, respecting the spirit and context of the original while incorporating contemporary innovation in materials, technology, and systems. Our firm has been fortunate to participate in some of the most prominent and important civic spaces in the US and at historic sites around the world. Our notable projects include contemporary interventions at landmarks and cultural icons that demonstrate respect for the buildings\u2019 original character by invisible modernization to extend the life of the buildings into the next century and continue to serve as civic icons for this and future generations.\nAt the core of our practice is the fundamental belief in and the pursuit of the meaningful coexistence of built structures with their surroundings. This core philosophy encompasses multiple scales and types of structures from the mutually beneficial interrelationship of civic buildings in urban fabric to new construction alongside buildings of historic vernacular. Our design philosophy is underpinned by a deep respect for the historic, cultural, and civic significance of a building or site. BBB has a commitment to architecture that simultaneously responds to current and future needs in a way that is intellectually relevant and contemporary in its own right. Our approach to understanding the past is complemented by an equal commitment to creative contemporary architecture in the present that ensures a lasting regeneration of our cities into the future.\nAs both architects and planners, we rely on the synthesis of four finely honed skills: master planning, rehabilitation of older buildings, restoration of landmarks, and the integration of contemporary architecture within historic settings. These themes are hallmarks of our work and will be applied to our planning for the Botetourt County new Circuit Courthouse project. As planners, we understand the large-scale forces that affect the future of a building, a campus, and a community. As architects, we enrich our planning efforts with technical and design expertise in assessing existing buildings, and envisioning spaces, additions, and new buildings that both support and transform them. Our ability to infuse long term planning with an architectural sensibility assures our clients that our plans are both visionary and achievable."

We have 180 staff across offices in Boston, New York, and Washington, DC, and the firm is renowned for the practice of saving buildings and repurposing them for their next incarnation.

As a result, the firm has won three Presidential Design Awards, the Medal of Honor from the American Institute of Architects New York Chapter, and the national AIA Firm Award. In 2020, BBB received a National AIA Award for the TWA Hotel restoration and the DC Award for Excellence in Historic Preservation for the Carnegie Library. \nBBB\u2019s Washington, DC Office will lead the effort for the Parks at Walter Reed. BBB is unique in having in-house architectural historians and conservators that work alongside the firm\u2019s architects and planners to provide in-depth historic research and technical analysis, which underpins the understanding of adaptive reuse projects. In-house conservators and preservation specialists allow BBB to efficiently carry out fa\u00e7ade and window surveys and seamlessly incorporate findings into construction documents. Furthermore, our architectural historian will lead the documentation needed for the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit under the direction of our Project Manager. \nFor this pursuit, BBB is joined by Perkins Eastman (PE) who will lead the senior living interior architecture. PE brings 41 years of experience with senior housing and hundreds of completed projects, many with SRG. Together, the BBB and PE team brings a compelling value proposition to the development team: \nInternational, award-winning renown in modernizations of historic buildings; \nNationwide expertise in senior living adaptive reuse projects; \nLocal credibility in regulatory design and preservation approvals on complex projects; \nUnlimited capacity to meet the schedule requirements; and \nNationally recognized experts in historic tax credits \n\nWe hope that our enclosed submission successfully reflects our enthusiasm and experience to lead this exciting project with the SRG, Hines, Urban Atlantic, and Triden development consortium."

We were founded in 1968 on the belief that New York City deserved our best attention as architects and planners. Foremost among our concerns was the preservation and revitalization of our urban environment. We believe that cities, neighborhoods, campuses, and buildings thrive on diversity and on the dynamic interaction of past, present, and future. It is in this spirit that we have helped to preserve and give new life to many venerable New York City -- and national -- institutions, assisting them in the stewardship of their physical and cultural assets. These include the U.S. Capitol, Grand Central Terminal, New York City Hall, Ellis Island, the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, South Street Seaport and the modern masterpiece TWA Flight Center at JFK International Airport."

The achievements of this philosophy have been recognized nationally with three Presidential Design Awards, the national AIA Firm Award (the highest honor given annually to a practicing architectural firm), an AIA Honor Award for Urban Design and Master Planning and more than 100 other awards.\nWe have grown into an international practice of 190 professionals in a wide range of disciplines - programming, city, regional and campus planning, urban design, architecture, historic preservation, interiors, construction administration, sustainable design, and architectural history and research. Our integrated, multi-disciplinary organization allows us to provide comprehensive services at all stages of a project\u2019s evolution. Our clients trust in the importance we place on details; our intimate understanding of how people will use and experience their environment; the incremental layering of new and historic elements; and our ability to synthesize design with execution. \nBBB is committed to a lasting regeneration of our built environment through responsive, informed and public-minded architecture and planning that respects the spirit and context of the original, yet incorporates the material, operational and perceptual realities of the 2lst century. Our planning projects provide design vision and direction with a well-rooted sense of identity. \nPlanning and design for educational institutions have been central to BBB\u2019s practice throughout our history. Educational institutions are complex, multi-layered communities that resonate with BBB\u2019s culture, philosophy, and foundation. Campus planning allows BBB to collaborate with and help guide educational institutions early on, from strategy and big-picture thinking through to implementation. We consistently work with our clients to find new and innovative ways to make projects more energy efficient and to reduce their impact on the natural environment.\n\nClients select BBB for our ability to listen and formulate consensus among the varied constituencies of the campus community. Our process for evaluating information and options, and arriving at a sound, cost-effective decision, comes from a spirit of collaboration among members of the team and the client."

We have experienced, both professionally and personally, the wide spectrum of outcomes that new developments can have on such neighborhoods. \n\nThe Bellwood Quarry area is home to a historically African-American community that has experienced decades of disinvestment and displacement, but is also benefiting from new investments and community-led revitalization. Regional investments like the Atlanta Beltline and forthcoming Westside Park present opportunities and also challenges for Atlanta\u2019s West Side residents. Microsoft has proposed an approach that places the community\u2019s needs at the forefront, laying the groundwork for an inclusive planning process that will support and enhance the existing community while offering new opportunities for housing and community impact. \n\nOur team deeply respects Microsoft\u2019s commitment to the area\u2019s residents, businesses, and institutions. As Corporate Vice President of Global Real Estate & Security Michael Ford stated earlier this year, many companies build new offices without regard for local neighborhoods, but Microsoft \u201cis going to reverse that; we\u2019re going to focus on community first.\u201d \n\nAt BBB, we pride ourselves on our ability to produce plans for future neighborhoods, campuses, and developments that are visionary, socially responsible, and deeply rooted to the mission, needs, and priorities of our clients. Organizations select BBB for our ability to listen, evaluate information and opportunity, facilitate consensus, and arrive at realistic options. We are open to a variety of perspectives, and we seek to procure and nurture a diversity of thought in our project teams. In the execution of our professional services, we encourage the involvement of Minority-owned Businesses (MBEs), Women-owned Businesses (WBEs), and other firms certified as diverse by third parties.\nThrough a robust process of engagement with both internal and external stakeholders, we develop each plan based on an understanding of the culture and character of the place, integrating social, economic, ecological, and infrastructural systems in a comprehensive view. Our resulting planning frameworks are based on an armature of both natural and built infrastructure, including existing transit networks, and emphasize the catalytic effect of public spaces to leverage economic development while supporting diversity and housing affordability.\n\nWhile we apply our values and best practices on every project, we do not believe there is a formula for campus planning, and we build a customized approach for each project. Community needs and aspirations are highly dependent on place, and the nature of the engagement process needed is also dependent on the specific client and community involved. We are prepared to actively listen, from the start, and to ensure that Microsoft, its customers, the neighborhoods of Grove Park and Bankhead, and the larger Atlanta metropolitan region all benefit from this integrated planning process."

BBB\u2019s comprehensive services include programming, architecture, historic preservation and adaptive reuse, interiors, campus planning, urban design, and graphic design throughout a project\u2019s evolution. Many of our projects involve the stewardship of historic buildings in sensitive urban sites\u2014the work for which we have become best recognized.\nPlanning and design for educational institutions is central to BBB\u2019s practice. In a portfolio that spans 50 years, BBB has helped to preserve and give new life to many institutions, including MIT and other venerable universities and colleges, assisting them in overseeing their physical and cultural assets. As planners and urban designers, our approach incorporates an understanding of the many factors and forces that affect the shaping of campus and community. As architects, we offer the technical expertise to optimize existing facilities, addressing programmatic requirements and the spaces that will best support them. Our integrated approach to architectural interiors further reinforces and communicates design intent, from historically appropriate restorations to cutting edge interventions, aligned with an institution\u2019s goals. \nBBB\u2019s work has been recognized with hundreds of awards, including the American Institute of Architects Firm Award, the highest honor given to a practicing firm, as well as three Presidential Design Awards and the Preservation League of New York\u2019s most prestigious commendation, the Pillar Award.\nAlternative second paragraph to above: used in [2020, 9/16 DCAMM House Doctor ONY32.20]\nWe are a recognized leader in bringing new life into historic buildings and campuses with creative, sustainable, and forward-looking renovations and additions; we are excellent listeners who adeptly translate the many and sometimes disparate priorities, needs, and concerns of stakeholders into successful projects; and we have the capacity, combined with the management and technical acumen, to bring complex, phased projects to fruition on time and on budget.

    "content": "BBB is a multi-discipline architecture firm rooted in the two key components of this project: master planning and historic preservation. We bring to this project over 50 years of experience in technical historic preservation, adaptive re-use, regulatory approvals, and master planning. Our experience developing comprehensive master plans for growth on historic campuses will allow us to support the Master Planner, anticipate inputs needed related to historic preservation, and schedule our work to meet the project goals. \nBBB is unique in having in-house architectural historians and conservators that work alongside our preservation architects providing in-depth historic research and technical analysis that underpins our understanding of adaptive re-use projects. Having an in-house architectural historian and conservator will allow us to efficiently complete detailed Historic Materials & Selective Salvage Assessment and Historic Materials Field Survey & Documentation reports. Our architectural historian, Katie Hummelt, has extensive experience conducting complex viewshed analyses to determine the effect of new construction on historic viewsheds.  \nDepending on the scope, scale, location, and viewsheds, new construction and major adaptive projects are often subject to regulatory design review. BBB\u2019s execution of highly visible historic projects has positioned us as a renowned expert in obtaining approvals from local and national reviewing bodies. Determining early what changes to the campus will be approved by the Lower Merion Township Historical Architectural Review Board is key to the success of the St. Charles Borromeo Master Plan. BBB, and the specific team members proposed for this project, have extensive experience facilitating informal meetings with reviewing agencies across jurisdictions to provide input in early design phases before a project is ready for a formal board review. Our understanding of the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation that will guide the Review Board\u2019s decision, coupled with our successful experiences in neighboring jurisdictions, will allow us to foster a productive and familial dialogue with Board and staff. This initial informal consultation will allow the team to understand the primary concerns of the Board and as the master plan progresses, we can discuss, without visuals, options considered in the Master Plan to garner feedback to progress the design without risk of developing a Master Plan that would not be approved. We understand the need to keep design information confidential and our approach to any informal consultation would include review with the owner, Hines, and Master Planner to discuss strategy and content prior to any meetings with reviewing agencies. \nThe BBB staff proposed for this project have specific experience cultivating these informal dialogues in multiple jurisdictions. For example, Jennie Gwin, the proposed Project Manager for the project, led the informal and formal project reviews with the Philadelphia Historic Commission, Pennsylvania State Historic Preservation Office, Philadelphia Art Commission, and Neighborhood Community Organization for the Philadelphia Family Court (1801 Vine Street) adaptive re-use project and is currently serving in that role for the revitalization of the Philadelphia 30th Street Station. Jennie has successfully completed similar informal consultations that led to project approvals in Copenhagen, Denmark and Washington, DC. Jennie\u2019s approach to design approvals is partially informed by her own work as a Commissioner on the Arlington County Historical Affairs and Landmark Review Board.\nThe adaptive re-use portions of the project appear very well suited for the Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit, a program jointly administered by the IRS and the National Park Service that provides a 20% income tax credit on qualified rehabilitation projects. BBB has extensive experience ushering adaptive reuse projects through the historic tax credit process, and we believe it would be a benefit to explore this as a potential financial tool for the project. Should the Owner and Development Advisor choose to pursue historic tax credits, BBB has the in-house team needed to document and usher the project though the tax credit approval process. Part of this documentation would be authoring the National Register of Historic Places nomination. BBB has authored National Register nominations for a range of historic properties, and we are able to work with owners to ensure the nomination reflects their interests in future use of the site.\nBBB is unique among our peers in our in-house capabilities for reality capture to document existing conditions. Depending on the scope of the project, we have two in-house options to collect accurate 3D data that can be easily shared with clients and other members of the design team. When a detailed BIM model is required, we employ our own team to laser scan the exterior and interior of existing buildings to produce a point cloud that we will use to create an existing conditions Revit model. We find that making the model ourselves is more efficient and provides our team an invaluable, in-depth understanding of the building. When a REVIT model is not needed, we employ a 3D camera that can quickly produce an accurate color 3D model of the site that can be dimensioned."

A framework, as opposed to a master plan, is a living document that allows for inevitable changes in needs, funding, and priorities over time. We pride ourselves on our ability to produce frameworks that are visionary and responsive to the institution\u2019s mission, as well as priorities of the client and stakeholder groups. Our visionary frameworks outline short- and long-term options within a broader established vision that integrates all campus systems. This approach also enables us to fast-track priority projects when needed into more detailed design and planning. \nSome of the examples of where we have successfully created flexible and implementable framework plans are Phillips Academy Andover, Phillips Exeter Academy, Masters School, Dartmouth, Amherst College, Bates College, and Colby College."

One such example was the first LEED-rated public school building for the New York State Education Department (SED): the new Hampton Bays Middle School, which achieved LEED Silver utilizing standard SED Wicks Law, publicly-bid, lowest-responsible-bidder rules. Although LEED and sustainable design/construction are now common in educational, public, and community projects, LEED was then in its infancy, so there was a steep learning curve for the design/CM and subcontractor team, who mastered the details of this achievement while completing the project on time and within budget. \nResearch, born of curiosity, is part and parcel of our practice, from materials research, to design innovation, to sustainability, to initiatives including RED (BBB\u2019s internal \u201cResearch, Exchange, Develop\u201d innovation program) and D2P. To cite only one example, BBB completed the first-ever WELL-certified multifamily residential building in New York City. We also create proprietary tools for project communication and management, including LiveBBBarch, our own secure, proprietary, online file-sharing site that enables more seamless transfer of documents across a fully integrated team."

This context is two-fold: it is the physical surroundings, often historic in character, that define and impact the site and it is the cultural context within which the project\u2019s objectives are defined. We come to understand this context through a deep exploration of an institution\u2019s mission and culture. We believe a design is successful if it is both an inevitable manifestation of its surroundings and its time, and of our clients\u2019 programmatic aspirations.\nIn a portfolio that spans 48 years, our work is distinguished by a contemporary interpretation of context, scale, and form. This approach has led to a wide spectrum of project types and the successful merging of new construction with existing buildings and campuses. Our process starts with a rigorous inquiry into the morphology of a building or site, which informs our approach to design in plan, form, and materials. Our approach to design is also highly collaborative: we strive to involve our client, their perspectives, and their mission into the design."

We will work collaboratively with New York Public Library (NYPL) to determine the best and most efficient way to validate prior programming studies and update the assumptions and findings.\nGathering programming information utilizes methods that can range from one-on-one or small group interviews with key administrators and department heads, to larger \"visioning\" workshops with students, faculty, and staff in order to better understand the culture of the school. Once data is gathered, it will be important to vet the \"blue sky\" vision in order to develop priorities. This type of analysis can take the form of benchmarking against peer institutions, and careful analysis of academic mission reports and prior history of growth on the campus.

Throughout our history, we have been champions of adaptive reuse, infusing new life into historic buildings. \n\nIt is this transformation that excites us the most\u2014unlocking the hidden potential that is embodied in an existing building. The transformation of an existing building does not have to be monumental, although it sometimes is. A small change to a building entry or circulation system can say as much about an institution\u2019s identity as a new structure.\n \nMost of our projects begin with documentation and recording of original and existing conditions, including the assemblage of archival material, testing, and probing. This preliminary research forms the basis for evaluating changes in use and condition over time and identifying the extent of work to be undertaken to reverse structural deterioration, preserve interior and facade elements, and restore missing or decayed aspects of the original design. This systematic, detailed evaluation of the building is essential and valuable groundwork, enabling us to recommend to our clients the best course of action to follow, and to prioritize the required and desired work within the available budget. \n\nBBB excels at designing additions and adding new space to sensitive historic buildings, whether by building on top, adjacent to, inside, or excavating below. In designing these expansions, both subtle and transformative, BBB often seeks to create a clear and frank architectural contrast between old and new, while composing a new totality that marries both. In each example of our work in finding space, the programs held within have grown and flourished in tandem with their physical expansion."

We have provided this service for [historic projects such as Brooklyn Navy Yard, Lincoln Center, the Morgan Library & Museum, Smithsonian Institution, the Architect of the Capitol, and the US Courts], among others. [We have provided this all-important conditions assessment and subsequent master planning for a variety of sacred, institutional, and cultural clients.] We have also provided existing conditions assessments as a basis for incremental upgrades at dozens of historical buildings and campuses, including NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn Navy Yard, St. Thomas Church, the General Theological Seminary, NYU, and the New-York Historical Society. As a result of this experience, we know how to prepare, organize, and summarize conditions assessments to be a useful tool for the future."

Cost management begins at the very start of the project, where we will understand your budget and what the programmatic aspirations are within that budget. Working with the estimator or construction manager, we will develop a cost model that will help guide the design. We are conscious of designing to the budget, and not simply hoping to attain our desired design. It is our responsibility to be creative in attaining the budget, while maintaining a realistic design intent. We participate actively in vetting estimates, reconciling, and developing alternates as needed at the end of each phase. It is our goal to manage costs from the outset to avoid late-phase value engineering decisions that may jeopardize program, scope, and design. We have gained valuable insight into critical coordination and construction issues along the way. Understanding all parties\u2019 objectives, changing goals or needs, changing schedules, communicating such changes via our drawings to the field, financial constraints, and the problems that inevitably arise, requires a very open and respectful dialogue with all team members."

Kohler Ronan will visit the site to locate, review and understand existing existing mechanical, electrical, plumbing and fire systems throughout the building. The illustrated report will identify and locate observed defects, diagnose their cause and recommend remediation. The report will reference back to the Preservation Mapping to enable specific spaces and conditions to be referenced against the most appropriate approach for that space or element. While the assessment does not address future building uses, discussions with the client group will help shape our recommendations to anticipate potential future uses wherever possible. \nThe condition of building systems forms an important part of the study. Kohler Ronan will review existing available MEP/FP system documentation, and locate and identify existing equipment and trace primary service distribution routes through the building. Kohler Ronan will interview staff to further understand the current system operations, known deficiencies and any current upgrade strategy. They will assist in developing system infrastructure and operational goals, including sustainability goals. A challenge throughout the building will be the sensitive integration of upgraded fire detection and alarm systems, and the Conditions Assessment will recommend approaches most appropriate to the historic building, its proposed uses and the collections."

These factors tend to affect the cost of the project and need to be dealt with and incorporated into the design process to allow the design team to achieve their design intent, without detracting from the project budget or the project\u2019s team creativity. We work closely with the client\u2019s Construction manager and the Client to develop a working approach to the project to ensure the building can remain functional as work progresses since many clients cannot afford to completely relocate for the duration of the work.\nBy way of example, at Central Place residential tower in Rosslyn, VA, near Washington DC, a construction administration team was assembled during the mid-point of the construction documents phase to assess all the changes to the project and the various cost impacts it would have\u2014both additive and deductive. This allowed our client, JBG Companies, to make critical decisions prior to the completion of the construction documents and still maintain their construction budget goals."

    "content": "Based on or previous experience, the key to making dormitory life more meaningful is getting students to view the residence hall as their Home. To achieve this requires a mix of spatial planning to encourage group interaction at a range of scales and enticing social and academic opportunities within the residential setting to draw students out of their rooms.\nOver the past three years, these objectives have shaped the planning and design process for Amherst\u2019s Greenway dorms precisely to ensure that the social spaces at the dorms have visibility, flexibility, and a sense of ownership among the entire student community. Creating similar spaces and clusters throughout the College will have far-reaching benefits, including distributing the energy throughout the campus, expanding the diversity of residential communities, and integrating socially and intellectually stimulating programs into student housing.\nOur ongoing work on House Renewal at Harvard College is an in-depth immersion into the importance of House culture and its impact on both program and design. As geographic locales and tight-knit communities, no two Harvard Houses are alike. Each has a particular set of architectural and cultural identities, a \u201csense of place\u201d that has emerged over the decades since the House system was implemented. A transformative concept of the late 1920s, the House system breaks down the larger college population of approximately 5,000 students into a more intimate academic environment of about 400 students with 40 dedicated staff. Much more than mere shelter, the Houses are a hallmark of the Harvard experience.\nThe ongoing House Renewal campaign achieves an even greater sense of community through design. Study nooks and residential common spaces encourage chance meetings and provide venues for group study. The traditional program has been enhanced to include seminar rooms to meditation and fitness; and larger scale spaces for social events such as lectures and House formals."

While the various team members have expertise in specific areas, their broad-based involvement throughout the process provides a quality control element that helps circumvent constructability and cost issues that can arise during construction. This integrated team approach is beneficial to the client in helping to balance the importance of design and practical matters of cost, schedule, maintenance, as well as logistical construction issues. The one-team approach provides a level of expertise and close coordination that will provide not only accurate information to the client but also provide more options for your decision-making process. \n\nBBB\u2019s emphasis on preconstruction services begins with a well thought out and attainable design schedule. The design schedule is our road map to success and should illustrate all the pertinent items required to achieve completion of the project. This focus on schedule does not restrict creativity. It does the opposite. It allows the client to clearly understand the time requirements to achieve an excellent design, while also directing the design team in the proper path with regard to the client\u2019s financial goals. We will assemble a detailed design schedule that includes the critical tasks for this project, while maintaining your construction milestone deadlines. This is especially important for a Design-Build project. The allows for a clear understanding of the various tasks for this project, the time allocations for each task, and the coordination requirements among all team members including the client. \n\nEqually important, we believe in a proactive approach to cost control, which is significant for this project. Cost management begins at the very start of the project, where we will understand your budget and what the programmatic aspirations are within that budget. Working with the estimator, we will develop a cost model that will help guide the design. We participate actively in vetting estimates, reconciling, and developing alternates as needed at the end of each phase. It is our goal to manage costs from the outset to avoid often painful late-phase value engineering decisions that may jeopardize program, scope, and design. \n\nFrom our design build project experience, along with all our fast track projects, we have gained insight into critical coordination and construction issues along the way. Understanding all parties\u2019 objectives, changing goals or needs, changing schedules, communicating such changes via our drawings to the field, financial constraints, and the problems that inevitably arise, requires a very open and respectful dialogue with all team members."

We believe that new buildings or additions must, in some way, be an expression of their time. Early 20th century buildings are an expression of their time, as should be 21st century buildings. New technologies in glazing, materials, and their synthesis in detailing give us a rich toolbox to articulate a design that is of our time and consonant with its context."

This is particularly the case in college residential projects, where a wide array of end users\u2014students, administrators, and house leaders\u2014have a vested interest in the successful outcome of the design. Firstly, we must understand the breadth of stakeholders and their respective decision-making responsibilities. We know that there is often some tension between end users\u2019 desires and the realities of budget, schedule, and constructability. There may be many voices and it is important for us to balance all parties\u2014including faculty, administration, trustees, and students\u2014to ensure that the project reflects the benefit of these groups\u2019 experience, standards, and knowledge.\nDuring the Framework Planning process, the Amherst community was consistently forthcoming with constructive ideas and insights. Our conversations with students, faculty, and staff benefited from the enthusiasm, candor, and eloquence of everyone who came to the table. Oftentimes, simply creating a forum for a structured and informed discussion was the spark needed to generate robust discussions about the broad benefits of potential options. \nOur experiences at Swing House and Winthrop House projects for Harvard have proven that it really does take a village to program, design, and executive a House Renewal project successfully.

As part of our wider team, they were important regulators of the programmatic and functional needs of the Houses. Their collective experience of the College provided a valuable perspective.\nFinally, early and ongoing input by students ensured that they feel a sense of ownership in the final design. Their perspectives may be for four years only, but their commitment to the future of the institution is enduring.

We work from the outset of a project to minimize risk and unknowns by understanding all aspects of existing buildings and their contexts to celebrate their history while amplifying their continued viability. Our renovation projects always start with the compilation of existing conditions analysis including a forensic building study, through site investigations and detailed archival research. \nOur project-specific approach is based on research and analysis, a thorough understanding of the cultural context, and the development of appropriate preservation methodologies and new design interventions. We give new life to historic projects through the sensitive and creative integration of contemporary spatial program accommodations, life safety, and infrastructure systems.\nBBB has decades of experience working on hundreds of buildings of many eras, continuously applying and deepening our knowledge base. Understanding the requirements for National Register Landmarks and National Register Listed Buildings, historic construction types, assemblies, and potential points of failure has enabled us to proactively predict issues or probe in the right places to find them early on. Our in-house expertise in historic preservation has allowed us the leadership and confidence to determine the best course of action, all in consultation with our clients and with an eye to budget and schedule.\nFood Service/Retail [Higher Ed, Northeastern Prequal, 4/16/2021, PNY32.80; section in blue included in 2020, 12/16 PEA Wetherell Complex Renovation PNY32.47]"

    "content": "Robust contemporary architecture and vibrant, well-maintained historic buildings can strengthen and complement one another to form a diverse whole and establish an inter-generational conversation that continues to inform the life of an institution. New architecture within a historic campus must first respond to campus planning principles that emphasize the coherence of the entire site, unified by landscape, while also forming a strong identity that celebrates its function and its role within the campus. This is especially true for spaces that are destinations for the entire campus community, where openness and engagement are key attributes. When thoughtfully conceived and carefully integrated, a new building may form subtle contrasts with its surroundings, such as emphasizing transparency and lightness to balance the solidity of surrounding structures."

    "content": "BBB\u2019s design philosophy is based on the belief in the power of architecture to empower people\u2014their interactions with each other and their connections to the physical fabric. Our work is generated from a deep and complete understanding of a project's context\u2014both the physical surroundings that define and impact a site and the cultural context which define a project\u2019s objectives. BBB has no \"one design fits all\" approach; we succeed in designing spaces that consistently enliven neighborhoods, streets, and storefronts because we acknowledge and reflect their specific environment. \n\nIn our ongoing work with Events DC on the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, the 9th Street NW kiosks are flexible, attracting and accommodating a diverse array of retailers. These spaces take advantage of the unique relationship between the street and the interior of the Convention Center.  Still, BBB understands the necessity for brand consistency across a diverse portfolio; we routinely incorporate client design standards and performance, policy, and technical criteria in the programming, design, and documentation of buildings. We bring integrity to both brand consistency and the qualities of place. The 9th Street NW kiosks also operate on this scale, presenting a cohesive design which unifies and invigorates the entire street. BBB's efforts, particularly during Construction Administration, finely calibrated the details at each kiosk to ensure a cohesive look despite varying site conditions.\n \nWe appreciate and thrive in the creative space where building performance metrics meet the unique and special aspects of individual buildings and structures. We are skilled problem-solvers who are flexible, creative, and experienced in working in existing buildings. We maintain design intent and budget despite unforeseen existing conditions, which can occur in any building - no matter how old. \n\nBBB will ensure that each decision made in this next phase for Nationals Park First Street retail spaces will enable the vision of the tenant who moves in next - acting as a launch pad, rather than a constraint. We know creation of good architecture is a collaborative process, requiring extraordinary dedication by the design team and active engagement of the client. We take responsibility and care to be facilitators of this collaboration, and to interpret program, vision, budget, and schedule into a successful architectural outcome. Through clear communication and an accurate interpretation and representation of the program and design, we build the consensus necessary to move the project forward. This ethos is proven through the long-standing and close relationships that we have formed with our clients.\n\nClose coordination with our consultant team ensures that critical decisions for each scope are flagged appropriately as inflection points, with all parties understanding any implications and trade-offs between options before proceeding. At the same time, we understand that these individual spaces are contribute to a larger whole: both in the neighborhood and Events DC's portfolio."

Through research and careful listening to the client (and what existing buildings tell us) we come to discovery: the kernel of an idea that unlocks the concept of a plan.\nWe have found that asking the right questions is as important as recording the answers\u2014in order to understand the client\u2019s vision as well as the program to successfully fulfill both the physical and human requirements of the project. We evaluate information impartially without preconceived solutions, and we encourage transparency in the sharing of information. In addition to being good listeners, we are good communicators.

The transformation of an existing building does not have to be monumental, although it sometimes is. A small change to a building, such as an entry or circulation system, or systems upgrade, can say as much about an institution\u2019s identity as a new structure. Undistinguished interior spaces can become inspiring with the right choices of finishes and lighting. New technologies and infrastructure can be as transformative as new architecture in revitalizing buildings and institutions.\nWe take great pride in our reputation for thorough construction documentation and durable technical solutions. We place an equal emphasis on construction phase services, enabling design intent to be followed through into built form.\nBBB\u2019s design philosophy very much aligns with NYCDDC\u2019s culture and mission\u2014as we consistently work to deliver public buildings, spaces, and infrastructure that support a thriving, equitable, sustainable, and resilient city."

    "content": "BBB\u2019s design philosophy is based on the belief in the power of architecture to empower people\u2014their interactions with each other and their connections to the physical fabric. Our design does not derive from preconceived formal ideas divorced from the specificity of the project at hand. Rather, it is generated from a deep understanding of the project\u2019s context. This context is two-fold: it is the physical surroundings that define and impact the site, and it is the cultural context within which the project\u2019s objectives are defined. For institutional projects, we come to understand this context through a deep exploration of an institution\u2019s mission and culture. We believe a design is successful if it is both an inevitable manifestation of its surroundings and its time, and of our clients\u2019 programmatic aspirations.\nOur design philosophy applies equally to the four skills sets for which we have achieved our reputation: rehabilitation and adaptive re-use of historic buildings, restoration of landmarks, integration of contemporary architecture within historic settings, and master planning for campuses and cities. We are better architects because we are also planners. That is, our ability to infuse our architectural approach with a planning sensibility assures our clients that our designs are both visionary and achievable. Our approach is responsive not only to building program but larger scale campus and community forces.\nAdapting older structures for new uses is perhaps the most potent expression of BBB\u2019s design philosophy. Throughout our history, we have been champions of adaptive re-use, infusing new life into historic buildings. It is this transformation that excites us the most \u2013 unlocking the hidden potential that is embodied in an existing building. The transformation of an existing building does not have to be monumental, although it sometimes is. A small change to a building, such as an entry or circulation system, can say as much about an institution\u2019s identity as a new structure. Undistinguished interior spaces can become inspiring with the right choices of finishes and lighting.\nWe do not see program scope, schedule or costs to be constraints on a project. Rather, they are parameters, much like the context of a building. We enjoy working creatively within these parameters. Most projects, and certainly academic projects, gauge success by the ability to stay on schedule. In particular, we are familiar with university schedules, which often put pressure to make the most of summer months, and minimize disruption during active semesters. We believe that early phase exploration of the existing building, and a clear and linear decision-making process facilitated by the A/E team, are keys to maintaining a consistency and quality of design as the project progresses, and helps to avoid late and painful compromises to scope and design. \nEarly and frequent cost modeling is a way to make sure that programmatic and architectural aspirations are achievable within the project budget. While we believe that the fundamental design approach should be locked in at the Schematic Design phase, the quality of the design will remain consistent as we explore details and finishes that further articulate the architectural concept.\nOur knowledge from prior projects, and a collaborative relationship among BBB, the client, and the construction manager will help keep the design, and project, on track. While each party has its area of expertise and interest, each needs to care equally about the elements of the project\u2019s success: design, function, schedule, and budget."

New architecture within a historic campus must first respond to campus planning principles that emphasize the coherence of the entire site, unified by landscape, while also forming a strong identity that celebrates its function and its role within the campus."

Understanding the requirements for National Register Landmarks and National Register Listed Buildings, as well as buildings within historic districts, lesser known older properties, buildings with historically sensitive interiors, historic construction types, and assemblies, has allowed us the leadership and confidence to determine the best course of action in restoration and rehabilitation, all in consultation with our clients and with an eye to budget and schedule. We have many projects, in particular, that fall within the Upper East Side Historic District. BBB\u2019s substantial track record in historic preservation has resulted in successful working relationships with federal, state, and local public agencies such as the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, State Historic Preservation Offices, and Landmarks Preservation Commissions. Our staff are thoroughly familiar with complying with the Secretary of Interior\u2019s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties in the areas of preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, and reconstruction."
